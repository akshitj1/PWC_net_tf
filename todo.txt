------- TODO
he normal initializer makes training unstable? replace with default
disparity maxes till 24?
lazy execution for speedup
-------- DONE
optimizers rms prop, adam
check how flow is compounded
unit test warp function
reduce max disp to 4
predict half res and bilinear interpolate
add regularization in loss? - Not done in tf impl.
adjust learning rate, epsilon for adam to 1e-4
assert lossfn shapes match: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/5441
replace resize with crop and pad - resize_with_crop_pad works as expected
adapt samples, input size to kitti 2012
optimize to batch size 8
